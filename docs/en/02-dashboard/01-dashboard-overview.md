# Dashboard

When you launch a workspace, the dashboard is the first page that you see. It houses a number of [widgets](03-manage-widgets.md) that give you a general view of your business at any given time. All incomes and expenses related widgets show accrued amounts with the exception of `Cash Flow` widget. You can learn more on accrual account [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accrualaccounting.asp#:~:text=Accrual%20accounting%20is%20an%20accounting,recognized%20in%20the%20same%20period.).
