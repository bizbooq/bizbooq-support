# How can I create a transfer?

Transfer is created when you want to move money from one account to another. For a single transfer, Ciniki creates a revenue and payment record for the accounts involved.

> Money transferred between transfers with different currencies will be converted to the currency of the receiving account based on the currency rates you have setup.
